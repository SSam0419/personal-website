        Hey there! I wanted to share some thoughts about my experience with side
        projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        {`I've been working on apps for both web and mobile. For web, I use
        Next.js, and for mobile, I use React Native. The JavaScript world is
        pretty cool to work with, I gotta say.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {`But you know what? Instead of talking about tech stuff, I want to focus
        on planning. I've realized UI is really important. As a full-stack dev,
        I often change code here and there. Backend changes, then frontend
        changes, then backend again... it can get tiring.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        {`So I've been thinking: why not spend a bit more time on designing and
        finalizing the UI first? It might save us from all that back-and-forth
        later.`}
      </p>

      <p>
        Just a thought I wanted to share. What do you think? Have you had
        similar experiences?
